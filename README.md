## Setup/Troubleshooting
Using the MoTheMoai.asl file requires you to have asl-help in your `Livesplit/Components/` folder.  If it isn't working, a missing asl-help is likely the problem, you can download asl-help here: [https://github.com/just-ero/asl-help/raw/main/libraries/UnityASL.bin](https://github.com/just-ero/asl-help/blob/main/lib/asl-help)
